# TodoMVC App Written in Vanilla JS in 2022

Seems it is pretty simple to build fairly complex things these days in modern JavaScript. We can take advantage of most features without crazy hacks. 

Here's my Vanilla JavaScript implimentation â€“ initial version took 60 minutes total to write (see first commit)

- 159 lines of code total
- No build tools
- JavaScript modules
- Inital implementation done in an hour, then cleaned it up with ~30 min of refactoring
