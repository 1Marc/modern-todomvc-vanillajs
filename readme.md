# TodoMVC App Written in Vanilla JS in 2022 fork by Halo Developers

It seems straightforward to build reasonably complex things using only modern JavaScript these days! We can take advantage of most newer features without hacks or polyfills.

Here's my Vanilla JavaScript implementation:

- ~200 lines of code total (compared to the official vanilla JS TodoMVC from 6 years ago was 900+ LOC)
- No build tools
- JavaScript modules

Criticism, PRs, and feedback are welcome!
